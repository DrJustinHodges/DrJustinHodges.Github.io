  <h1 id="title"> ABOUT</h1>
  <p><p>My name is Justin Hodges and I am the senior AI/ML specialist at Siemens Digital Industries. I sit in a product management role for our portfolio of simulation software. I earned my bachelors, masters, and Ph.D in mechancial engineering at the University of Central Florida in thermofluids. I grew up in a Siemens Energy turbomachinery lab characterizing heat transfer, fluid mechanics, and turbulence in gas turbine secondary flow systems. My masters and doctoral research was on film cooling flow-fields, predicting turbulence and thermal fields with advanced turbulence modeling and machine learning approaches.</p>
<p>During an internship in Princeton NJ in 2017, I fell in love with AI and have been building my technical proficiency with such since. In that time, we patented work which incorporated CFD flow-field results, based on CT scans, into machine learning models. Incorporating information from clinical surveys, (physical) breathing measurements, and CFD results into a machine learning framework provides improved diagnosis of COPD.</p>
<p>From then until now, I have made constant professional efforts to augment the capabilities of engineering simulation by virtue of machine learning. I help real customers solve relevant problems which add value to their business and delievered products. Whether it be more convenient/faster workflows, more accurate simulations, or better connectedness of multi-disciplinary teams and data, it is my passion to expand the usage of machine learning for the benefits of those in industry.</p>
<p>I made this web page because I have an insatiable passion for digital innovation. I wanted to document some of my select projects which apply machine learning approaches to simulation problems and datasets.</p>
